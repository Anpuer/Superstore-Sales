## IV. Insights
- From 2011 to 2014, the economic growth rate tended to increase every year, profit margins did not fluctuate signifcantly.
- In each year, revenue tended to increase steadily until the fourth quarter and then fell sharply in the first quarter of the following year.
- The customers segment that brings in the largest revenues is **Consumer** (51,48% of total revenue from sales).
- EMEA and Africa are the two markets with the largest profit margins (**EMEA**: 35.98%, **Africa**: 34.02%) while revenue is quite low.
- The top 3 main revenue-generating markets are APAC (3.59M $), EU (2.94M $), and US (2.3M $). Technology products account for the largest proportion.
- USE is the country that brings in the most revenue.
- The kind of "**Office Supplies**" product (mainly about binders, labels, paper, ...) have the highest profit margin and also is the kind of product that have the lowest return rate.
- Top 5 sub-categories brought the biggest revenue: **Phones** (1.7M), **Copiers** (1.5M), **Chairs** (1.5M), **Bookcases** (1.4M), and **Storage** (1.2M). Most of them are **Technology** and **Furniture**
- There is a hole difference between the sales of top salesperson and other.
- The EMEA and Canada markets have only one salesperson.
- APAC and EU markets have very high average sales but the average shipping costs for these markets are also the largest.
- According to statistics, products in EMEA, Africa and Canada are not returned, the remaining markets have similar return rates, lead by the EU (6.18%).
## V. Recommendations
- Research the reasons why sales often drop at the beginning of the year to find the right business development plan.
- Continue to focus on markets that bring clear business results such as APAC, EU and US.
  - In the APAC market, focus on Technology and Furniture industries, which bring in high revenue. Revenues are high but profits are not as expected, so businesses should set up more factories or warehouses right in this market to optimize costs.
  - In the EU market, should also place more factories or warehouses like the APAC market. Concentrate on Technology and Office Supplies. Special attention should be paid to Office Supplies, there are potential products (about binders, labels, paper,...) need to be exploited for more investment.
- Besides, it is also necessary to invest more in the two markets with the highest profit margins: EMEA and Africa.
- Promote up-sale and cross-sale activities to increase the order value.
- It is necessary to optimize employee performance, and at the same time reallocate the employee force to each market, or recruit more employees.
